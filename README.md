# Bimage
made entirely by @saqqwd on discord (@immayr on yt, @now420 on github)<br>
was gonna remake this in c#, c++, java, etc but i got lazy so u can port yourself with a pull request and i'll (probably) add it to the main repo<br>
features:
- multi-line encryption
- supports all ascii characters
- sigma
